Hello! 

Welcome to StowQR! 

To see our application, please download all files into the same folder on your desktop. Then, open index.html and dashboard.html. 

The objective is to open the initial page(index.html), sign in, and then be redirected to the dashboard. Still, since we haven't implemented the sign-in functionality yet, you must open the dashboard.html page separately. 

Please note that we have just started with the frontend and are still working on the backend functionalities.
